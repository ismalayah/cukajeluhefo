The Addams have been like an extended family to audiences for decades, ever since Charles Addams’ comic strip creations were first brought to life in the legendary 1960s sitcom. For modern viewers, though, it’s likely the 1990s versions of the characters who they imagine when they think of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Addams Family</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>1991’s The Addams Family and its 1993 sequel Addams Family Values were the first cinematic adaptations of the gothic brood. While Barry Sonnenfeld’s quirky direction deserves praise, it’s fair to say that the flawlessly assembled cast is what has ensured the films have only grown in popularity over the years. Netflix’s upcoming reimagining, Wednesday, starring Jenna Ortega in the title role, has its work cut out for it in replacing these films in the hearts of fans.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>But what are the cast of the ’90s Addams Family movies up to these days? From major stars to those who’ve walked away from the spotlight, here’s a guide to what happened to the Addamses.</p><h2 id=h-angelica-huston data-injectable=false>Angelica Huston</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Angelica Huston was perfect casting as Morticia Addams, the ever-poised doting wife and mother of the clan. Huston herself is part of a legendary family — when she earned herself an Oscar for her breakthrough role in 1985’s Prizzi’s Honor, she became the third Huston to receive the accolade. At 71, Huston is less prolific than she used to be, but she notably played The Director in John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum.</p><h2 id=h-raul-julia data-injectable=false>Raul Julia</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by This, That, Film Facts!

A hugely revered star of the stage and screen, with Tony, Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG awards to his name, Julia tragically passed away from stomach cancer at the age of 54 in 1994. His loss was a major reason a third Addams Family with the same cast and crew never surfaced.</p><h2 id=h-christopher-lloyd data-injectable=false>Christopher Lloyd</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Christopher Lloyd completely physically transformed himself to play the Addams’ Uncle Fester, so it’s easy to forget he’s the same man who brought Doc Brown to life in the Back to the Future trilogy. Now 83, Lloyd is still working hard to this day, appearing in four movies in 2021 alone.

As of 2017, he was known to be a member of Hollywood trade union group Teamsters Local 399. It’s his IRL sister who is the more famous face these days — Modern Family star Ariel Winter.

In the first, she cameos as a girl scout freaked out by Wednesday and, in the second, she has a much bigger role as Amanda, Wednesday’s nemesis at Camp Chippewa. Still, McNab is most recognizable for her turn as Harmony in both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff, Angel. Now 42, McNab has not acted professionally since 2011.</p><h2 id=h-joan-cusack data-injectable=false>Joan Cusack</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-102147428-1.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>Joan Cusack achieved the impossible in Addams Family Values by managing to out-OTT the Addams themselves as psychotic nanny Debbie Jellinsky. The two-time Academy Award nominee has continued to improve everything she’s been in ever since. Notably, she played Sheila Jackson in Shameless, earning herself five consecutive Emmy noms (and one win) and, as we all know, voiced Jessie in Toy Storys 2, 3, and 4.</p><h2 id=h-david-krumholtz data-injectable=false>David Krumholtz</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by David Krumholtz (@davidkrumholtz)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=745 data-injectable=true>David Krumholtz got his big break in Addams Family Values, playing Wednesday’s nerdy love interest Joel.

Nearly 30 years later, Krumholtz is reprising the character in Disney Plus’ upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Santa Clauses</a>, which will see him reunite with Tim Allen.

Though already a familiar face, MacNicol became a household name later that decade thanks to Ally McBeal. In recent years, the 68-year-old has mostly focused on voice work in various animated series and video games, but he has been seen in guest and recurring spots on the likes of Veep and The Big Bang Theory.</p><h2 id=h-christine-baranski data-injectable=false>Christine Baranski</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=false>Yes, the icon that is Christine Baranski was also in Addams Family Values, playing Gary Granger’s wife and co-camp counselor, Becky Martin-Granger.
