Nowadays, this sequential storytelling has become popularized by the likes of Shonen manga, like One Piece or Bleach. There are, however, many genres within the manga-verse, one of them being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>BL</strong></a> — scary genre, I know.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=564 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>BL is, at the very etymology root of the word, the genre that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">includes boys’ love, or romance</a> between two male characters, and it can date back to the 1970s with the term “yaoi.” Since then, that term has become outdated, bringing “BL” as the main name used <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for any romance between two males in entertainment media</a>. The BL industry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">became even more sought-after in the last few years</a> because of TikTok (much like everything), and it started receiving just as much backlash as it gets love – but we’ll pay no mind to ignorance.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>For that reason, here are some of the best BL manga to get you kick-started in the vast world of Boys’ Love.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>15. Fangs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fangs.jpg><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Fangs introduces quite an over-exploited plot in BL – vampires – but unlike quite a few of the manga with the same trope, it portrays it absolutely beautifully. The art is simply phenomenal, and the story depicts the life of a young vampire becoming acquainted with this new life he ought to live eternally, unknowing of the rules that he now had to face; and a patient member of the health and welfare division of the vampire rights organization, helping the youngling into a journey that leads them both to develop themselves individually, and as a pair.&nbsp;Fangs is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">INKR</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>14. MODS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MODS.jpg><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>Like many of the entries on this list, MODS has quite the explicit material in its storytelling, nonetheless, it is still a marvelous manga to get you acquainted with the genre. Touching on the overtly exhausted escort versus savior trope in BL – you’ll see it again on this list, in fact – with enough grace to make it so beautiful, MODS is almost an entrance-level manga for anyone wishing to learn more about BL. Plus, its sequel story Night Before Night, is equally as interesting and engaging (if not more), and both are available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Manga Planet</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>13. Like the Beast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Like-the-Beast.jpg><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>Like the Beast (Honto Yajuu) is quite possibly one of the most popular BL manga of all time. The author – Yamamoto Kotetsuko – is already a well-known beloved name in the genre, meaning that nearly every single one of their works will be loved and praised thoroughly. Personally, I’m picking Like the Beast for this list because it was my first BL manga, and it set the standards so high that I struggled to find something as good as this story for the longest time. It is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MangaPlanet</a> (formerly, Futekiya).&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>12. Boy Meets Maria</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Boy-Meets-Maria.jpg><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=true>Boy Meets Maria is unique, to say the least. Very few BL manga are capable of introducing such an idiosyncratic concept and managing to deliver a beautifully illustrated and captivating story, just like Boy Meets Maria did. Revolving around a boy wanting to become a hero and his schoolmate who unknowingly becomes his hero(ine), Boy Meets Maria touches on several subjects that most BL do not dare touch, showing a realistic side of gender dysmorphia, and acceptance.&nbsp;To read this, go to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seven Seas Entertainment</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>11. Midnight Rain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Midnight-Rain.jpg><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>With a realistic story and absolutely endearing characters, Midnight Rain is possibly one of the best-written BL manga you could ever get your hands on. This story is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SuBLime </a>and depicts the raw and adoring love between Ethan, who is living a monotonous life, and Mike, whose life has just turned itself upside down. Constantly bickering, yet always with a hint of flirtation, Midnight Rain is surely the most beautiful choice you can make when choosing what to read next.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-10-seven-days data-injectable=false>10. Seven Days</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/seven-days.jpg><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Seven Days is a sweet coming-of-age story written by Venio Tachibana and Rihito Takarai. This BL manga is&nbsp;a great stepping stone into the genre for its exciting and engaging plot, as well as an excellent art style that immediately catches the eye of the reader.

The manga is currently available in English at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebook Renta</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Black or White</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/black-and-white.jpg><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=873 data-injectable=true>Black or White is an ongoing manga series written by Sachimo in 2017. This story pursues a story with much more mature themes. Introducing the world of Japanese entertainment, Black or White is a story about two actors who have been lovers since they were university students.

Megumi And Tsugumi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/megumi-and-tsugumi.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>Megumi and Tsugumi is the perfect introduction for the omegaverse sub-genre in BL manga. The complex and alternating universe of “Omegaverse” entails the existence of the sub-genders alpha, omega, and beta. These sub-genders, in most Omegaverses, imply that regardless of someone’s gender, they can reproduce as long as they are omegas impregnated by an alpha- even males.</p><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>However outlandish this sub-genre may be, it is an extremely popular trope in BL, requiring some adjusting for new readers. Megumi and Tsugumi show the omegaverse trope through two male high school characters who absolutely despise each other, until Megumi, an alpha, realizes that the school’s delinquent is a rather unique omega. This different take on the roles usually found in omegas and alphas creates an extremely fun story for everyone wanting to know more about the world of Omegaverse in BLs, on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebook Renta</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7.

In a story where hierarchy reigns at an unorthodox high school, Caste Heaven introduces the story of high school students who are forced to play a cutthroat card game to determine their social ranks – from the King to the Joker, otherwise known as Targets.

In a well-rounded and convoluted world, Birds of Shangri-La retells the story of a male brothel called Shangri-La, where prostitutes are essentially treated like gods. Phi, one of the brothel’s most sought-after sex workers, is placed in charge of initiating Apollo into his role of “teaser”, also known as the people who get the “birds” ready for their clients.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Apollo and Phi, in spite of the strict rules, end up getting closer than initially thought, coming off as a surprise due to Apollo’s (alleged) heterosexuality and tragic past.
