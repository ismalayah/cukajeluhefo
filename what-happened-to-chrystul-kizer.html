Volar III, was released from custody after several community groups raised her bail. Volar was suspected of sexually trafficking and abusing Kizer, a teenager, when Volar died, and two years later, it seemed Kizer’s charges <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">might be dropped</a>.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>A judge told Kizer, however, that she could not commit any other crimes as a condition of her 2020 release. But in early 2024, Kizer was back on the run. In mid-February, Kizer was caught in Louisiana, and as of this report, <a href=#>she was expected to be extradited to Wisconsin</a>. Here’s what Kizer allegedly did to find herself on the wrong side of the law.</p><h2 id=h-kizer-was-charged-with-a-misdemeanor data-injectable=false>Kizer was charged with a misdemeanor</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>via Fox 6 News Milwaukee/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=#>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>, in Jan. 2023, Kizer, now 23, was accused of a single disorderly conduct and domestic violence misdemeanor while out on bail. As a result, she was charged with four counts of felony bail jumping, and she fled the state. Kizer says the January domestic violence incident in Milwaukee involved an attempted rape.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>When the authorities caught up with Kizer in Louisiana, however, she was with David Melton, age 47, the registered sex offender who she alleges sexually assaulted her in January, <a href=#>FOX6now.com</a> reported. With her new charges, Kizer risks forfeiting the $400,000 bail relating to Randall P.

As well as shooting Volar, Kizer is accused of setting his house on fire and stealing his car, and Kizer never denied she pulled the trigger.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Given the circumstances of the case, several community organizations, including The Chrystul Kizer Defense Committee, Chicago Community Bond Fund, and the Milwaukee Freedom Fund, worked together to raise bail. In July 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post </a>reported Kizer could be acquitted of all charges, based on a Wisconsin court ruling.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>That court decision was based on a Wisconsin law stating sex trafficking victims could either be acquitted of crimes committed while trafficked or have the opportunity to face lesser charges, which, in Kizer’s case, would mean second-degree rather than first-degree homicide charges.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>At that time, Kizer’s public defender, Colleen Marion, said,</p><p>“Chrystul Kizer deserves a chance to present her defense, and today’s decision will allow her to do that. While the legal process on this matter is far from over, we, along with Chrystul and her family, believe the decision today affirms the legal rights provided by Wisconsin statute to victims of sex trafficking facing criminal charges.”</p>via WaPo<p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>If you know someone suffering from sexual violence, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RAINN</a>&nbsp;or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hknKCirsC1wctmoqKylad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
