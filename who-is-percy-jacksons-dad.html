It only makes sense, then, for the TV show to be made of the same stuff, serving as a faithful adaptation of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the beloved book series</a>. Naturally, this means that it also raises the same queries in brand-new fans.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Of course, as the protagonist starts to re-discover the world as he knows it, he has more than a few questions to ask. One of the most important ones, though, pertains to his father. I mean, it’s not every day that one finds out their dad is a god, so it’s only natural to want to know which one.</p><h2 id=h-which-god-is-percy-jackson-s-father data-injectable=false>Which god is Percy Jackson’s father?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/riptide.png><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Percy Jackson’s father is Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology. This revelation comes fairly early into the series, when Percy is claimed as Poseidon’s son, but it takes a bit longer for the boy to meet his dad in person. Rest assured, though, they meet face-to-face in the first book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lightning Thief</a>, and then on several occasions throughout the series.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=false>That said, Poseidon is not a main character in the story, and his appearances tend to be quick. Despite his absence throughout most of his son’s life, though, the god does hold affection for Percy and claims that he is the favorite among his children. Why did Poseiden abandon Percy, then? Well, that’s part of a completely different conversation, but trust that he had his motives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxloJq%2FpMWMo5ico6Oku7R5w5qbaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
