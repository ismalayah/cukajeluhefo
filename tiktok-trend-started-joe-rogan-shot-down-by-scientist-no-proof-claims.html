Now, millions look to shysters, snake oil salesmen, and “influencers” and, as a result, a <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Rogan</a></strong> bit needs a debunking.<strong></strong></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=802 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>For those who have never watched or listened to the comedian’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Joe Rogan Experience</a> podcast on the platforms where it is hosted (you are lucky, on a side note), he often has guests on who run the gamut from widely accepted to wackadoodle. A recent person from the latter group who came on to chat with him was YouTube broadcaster Jimmy Corsetti, and, while speaking, he shared the nonsensical “Adam and Eve” theory that the Earth flips every 6,500 years 90-degrees for six days and on the seventh day corrects itself. In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clip</a>, Corsetti — who has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no degree</a> in science but instead went to school for marketing, communications, and religious studies — says the idea “is science” and when it happens there will be chaos like mankind has never seen in its history.</p><p>“Earth essentially does a standstill, the sun will be direct — will basically stay in the same spot, causing heating like we’ve never experienced — and that the wind and the waters continue with their momentum, because essentially the wind travels at approximately 1,000 miles an hour at the equator, so the theory is that when that event happens it’s going to be cataclysmic.”</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>In the aftermath, posts resharing the claims from the man who has also theorized on Atlantis (which the ancient Greeks <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">did not</a> take seriously whatsoever) and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> you can cure years of depression in days thanks to a dry sauna (yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">really</a>) have racked up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">millions</a> of views. TikTok has pledged to counteract such content with a new policy against disinformation, but, so far it remains accessible and over at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, actual scientist Martin Mlynczak of NASA’s Langley Research Center says this is ludicrous.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p>“It’s just unfortunate that these things are being put out there. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And there’s no proof and no science and no physics behind any of the claims about the magnetic field change being associated with climate change. There’s no evidence that the planet has or ever will make that kind of 90-degree flip — where the Arctic would be where the Antarctic is and vice versa. That is total bogus. If that’s what happened every 6,500 years, we would certainly see it; it would be in all records … The amount of energy to bring that about is tremendous. You know, there’s nothing to initiate it.”</p><p data-characters=649 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Earth’s magnetic poles DO shift, but not remotely in the way mentioned in Rogan’s podcast and subsequent TikTok videos. The process takes place very slowly and has only reversed 183 times over the last 83 million years and, when it does occur, the magnetic field weakens and then grows in strength in the opposite direction. If one happens, human beings are likely to not notice it whatsoever and when pressed about the theory, Corsetti told The Verge he was taken out of context in TikTok videos. He says in the full show he is explaining differences between normal science and theoretical belief and theories are not accepted science.</p><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>As well, the “Adam and Eve” theory comes from a 1965 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> by Chan Thomas. In it he also claims Jesus was abducted by aliens and considering this is a major part of Corsetti’s channel and Rogan’s show, it is likely it could be revisited by them in the future in between talk about aliens, time traveling, false nonsense about the 9/11 attacks, and the idea that space is somehow a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fake concept</a>. All of those are real segments, and, there is no word on whether they have turned the brains of those who watch into pudding.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Where’s Bill Burr for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a dressing-down</a> when we need him? Probably busy, but, if he ever did address the nonsense on Rogan’s show again, he would certainly have a lot to work with. The host has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fooled</a> by fake vaccination tweets, has talked about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shooting</a> the homeless, said he may bring Andrew Tate on to have a conversation, and has shared fake <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Seagal</a> news in addition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbXKraakZaSnsq%2BwjKyrmqqkmrFuts6eZKunl5a7br%2FHqKtmnJ%2Bsu26u2GaqnKGVo8Gqv9NmpahloKe8sLKMnKOaoZ2ofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
