She has already seen some mainstream traction with supporting parts in 21 Jump Street and Don Jon. Meanwhile,&nbsp;her indie credibility is at its apex right now, a result of her remarkable turn in the superb drama Short Term 12 last year, which I included on my list of <a href=#>10 great movies from 2013 that you probably missed</a>. Her turn in that film notched Larson some well-deserved awards buzz. Now, on her steady path to conquer Hollywood, the actress has signed on to <strong><a href=#>Trainwreck</a></strong> for producer/director Judd Apatow and sketch actor and writer Amy Schumer.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Trainwreck is a star vehicle for Schumer, who already has a hit sketch comedy series on Comedy Central and is a fresh but raucously funny talent on that channel’s celebrity roasts. Plot details are still under wraps, although the film will focus on a basket case played by Schumer who is trying to figure out her life.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>When news of the casting first came around, Apatow and company were looking for actors to fit the protagonist’s boyfriend and best friend. Larson is only a few years younger than Schumer and it seems like a good bet that she will be Schumer’s close confidante. Bill Hader is also part of the cast, although his part is unconfirmed (he may be a bit too old to play Schumer’s beau). Trainwreck is set for a release on July 24, 2015 – a good sign, as it means Apatow is confident enough with the material to give it a berth during the summer movie season.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Alongside Jennifer Lawrence (whose star power has exploded over the last couple of years) and Greta Gerwig (who still remains an indie darling), Larson is another young actress with talent to spare who deserves all the attention she is getting. She is game for comedy, as her small stint on Community proved, and she can be seen next in the musical&nbsp;Basmati Blues and in the thriller The Gambler with Mark Wahlberg.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=105 data-injectable=false>Tell us, are you happy to see Brie Larson joining&nbsp;<strong>Trainwreck</strong>?
