How hilarious is that?</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>Aside from Evalin and her trusty tissue box, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Georgas</a> admitted that she loved having an eye mask for bedtime, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy Kent</a> loved having sticky boobs for her backless dresses, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lea Cayanan</a> loved having an extra mirror for getting ready.
