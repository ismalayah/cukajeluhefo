So what about skipping the usual suspects and having Tom Holland’s wallcrawler face off against Mister Negative?</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Mister Negative is a character who needs no introduction for anyone who’s played Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man, which plucked the villain from obscurity to make him a modern-day counterpart to Norman Osborn’s Green Goblin, what with his dual personality. His unique visual look is also a major draw for the foe and would be intriguing to see realized in the movies.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>OK, so let’s say Negative in Spider-Man 4 got a positive reception at Marvel Studios; who could play him? Fans have the perfect answer. Namely, Donnie Yen, the master martial artist probably best known to American audiences for Rogue One and John Wick: Chapter 4.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Donnie Yen for a live-action Mister Negative.</a><br>by<a href=#>u/AbeliousAugustus</a> in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>In case you need your memory jogged, Yen’s role in the Star Wars universe was Chirrut Îmwe, a blind semi-Jedi monk, while he turned up in the most recent John Wick flick as Caine, a blind assassin. Although Mister Negative isn’t blind, Yen would no doubt relish a role like that as he was very keen during these two prior Hollywood appearances to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">subvert expectations and tropes</a> surrounding Chinese characters. Negative’s a well-rounded antagonist who doesn’t fall back on such stereotypes so you’d imagine Yen would jump at the chance if it were presented to him.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>Of course, one significant hitch to casting Yen as Mister Negative would be the fact that the actor is currently 60 years old and the Spider-Man villain is generally depicted as a man of younger years. An alternate, and equally tempting, actor suggested in the comments to this Reddit thread is Terry Chen, who you might know from The Expanse or The Last of Us. Chen even has MCU history, playing Pryce Cheng in Jessica Jones season 2.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>However Spider-Man 4 shapes up, it had better get its act together fast as fans are getting antsy (spidery?) for more of Tom Holland’s Peter Parker, preferably with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more of Zendaya’s MJ in tow</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2ZomLEor7SZpinnF2fvKm6jLCgnKNdqMGivoyaqmaroJ6xpr6Mppinq12jsrnAjKecpp2jnsBuw86uo51llKR6tbTEZqScrV2WeqnBxp5kn5mmpL9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
