He revealed that he was pansexual, meaning he was attracted to individuals, not their sex or gender. “Bisexual — with an open mind!” Brady told the outlet.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Brady came out to Taketa, who remains his best friend, and his daughter before going public, and they gave him their full support. In the interview, Brady further explained what pansexual meant to him and why he identified as such.</p><p>“In doing my research, both with myself and just with the world, I couldn’t say if I was bisexual, because I had to really see what that was, especially because I really have not gotten a chance to act on anything,” Brady said. “So, I came to pansexual because — and I know that I’m completely messing up the dictionary meaning — but to me, pan means being able to be attracted to anyone who identifies as gay, straight, bi, transsexual or non-binary. Being able to be attracted across the board. And, I think, at least for me for right now, that is the proper place. I took pan to mean that not only can I be attracted to any of these people or types physically, but I could be attracted to the person that is there.”</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>He also said that he had been attracted to men his whole life, but he had never acted on it because of how he was raised. Brady struggled for years letting the public know how he felt on the inside.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=false>And now that he can live without burying his secret, he said he’ll continue working toward being the “best Brady” he can be to the people in his life, including his daughter and future partner, and his fans across the globe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnWmrCnnV2Xv6Kw2GaemrFdqbWmedGupKiqo2KyubzLmqCnnZRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
