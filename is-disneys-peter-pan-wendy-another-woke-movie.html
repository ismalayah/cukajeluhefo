Well, Disney’s casting of actors and actresses who aren’t white in roles that have previously only been filled by white actors, as well as female characters where previously there have only been males, is one prime example.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Indeed, the conversation of wokeness is complex, non-linear, and chock-full of opinions. But we’re hoping we can whittle it down to some facts for you (with a little opinion sprinkled in).&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-is-disney-s-peter-pan-wendy-woke data-injectable=false>Is Disney’s ‘Peter Pan & Wendy’ woke?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>We are going to make this short and sweet because there’s no use in belaboring the point (and because the mere question of whether Peter Pan & Wendy is woke just reiterates the negative connotation Americans have bestowed upon the word in recent years).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Yes, Peter Pan is now played by a mixed-race actor (Alexander Molony). Yes, Tinker Bell is not played by (yet) another white actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">(Yara Shahidi)</a>. Yes, Captain Hook’s crew has some diversity in it because, contrary to popular belief, not only white men become pirates. And, yes, the Lost Boys now include some Lost Girls because girls are orphaned, too.</p><p data-characters=853 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>If all of those examples mean the movie is “woke,” then yes, the movie is woke. In reality, the movie is simply an accurate reflection of what the world looks like today. Just because Hollywood has whitewashed (and man-washed) its movies for over a century does not actually mean that is what the world looks like, even though that is exactly the kind of ideology that has seeped into the societal consciousness as a result. One look around you will show that the world is filled with people who are Black, Asian, Southeast Asian, Hispanic, LatinX, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, Native American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Mixed, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, and every other box we’re forced to check to make sense of our identities. So, the characters in our movies should look the same, should they not?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>It can sting when a popular intellectual property such as Peter Pan is reimagined with a modern approach, especially when it’s rooted in beloved childhood memories. But it should sting more that we ever thought it was okay to love a movie so limited in its representation. That’s just not what the world looks like. So, our movies shouldn’t look like that, either.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>So, we’ll leave you with that and one final question. Is the problem that the movie is “woke,” or should the problem be that it was once fully white (fully straight, fully cis-gendered, fully male, etc…) with a few token diversity characters to begin with?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>Should you desire to check out the wokeness for yourself, Peter Pan & Wendy is currently streaming on Disney Plus. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read our full review here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxllJ7Ar7HYrGSpnaSav268wKdksJ2emcZurc2oq6GdomLEsLfEZqSorpmafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
