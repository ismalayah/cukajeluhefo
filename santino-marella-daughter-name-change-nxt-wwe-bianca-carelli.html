According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cagematch.com</a>, Carelli had only worked eight matches in her career prior to signing for WWE, but that likely made her signature even more appealing to WWE higher-ups, who don't have to worry about wasting too much effort training her to unlearn habits she picked up on the indies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The NXT Women's Tag Team Championship Is Already Pointless</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“In a couple of years, I can’t wait to go to WrestleMania just as a parent going to watch their kid," Santino said of his daughter's signing during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent chat with WWE Hall of Famers JBL and Gerald Brisco</a> on their podcast.
