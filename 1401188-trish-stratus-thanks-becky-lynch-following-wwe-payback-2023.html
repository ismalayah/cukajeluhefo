Her opponent was none other than former RAW Women’s Champion Becky Lynch. “Thank You Trish” has been a popular phrase this year but after their match, the wrestling legend thanked The Man.</p><p>Both Lynch and the 47-year-old veteran had been feuding with each other for several months. It all began on the Road to WrestleMania 39. Trish Stratus made a shocking return to help <a href=#>Lita</a> and The Man take out Damage CTRL on the grand stage.</p><p>A couple of weeks later, Stratus teamed up with Lynch in an attempt to defend the Women’s Tag Team Championships against <a href=#>Liv Morgan</a> and Raquel Rodriguez. This was after Lita was taken out backstage earlier in the night. Unfortunately, Trish and Lynch <a href=#>lost the match</a> and the tag titles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/05/Raquel-Rodriguez-Liv-Morgan-WWE.jpg><p>Following the match, Trish Stratus turned on <a href=#>Becky Lynch</a> by attacking her from behind. This then led to a match at Night of Champions. Thanks to some help from Zoey Stark, Stratus managed to pick up the win.</p><p>From then on, every time the two stars wrestled each other on Live Television the match either ended in a disqualification or a no-contest. The feud finally culminated at last week’s Payback PLE. After a hard-fought battle, Lynch overcame the odds and defeated Stratus.</p><p>Last night, Trish Stratus took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> to share a photo highlighting her bruises from the Steel Cage match. In the post, she also thanked Becky Lynch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After the match, <a href=#>Zoey Stark</a> also parted ways with the Hall of Famer. She hit the Z-360 laying Stratus flat in the ring. It seems like the wrestling legend might be feuding with her protege in the upcoming weeks.</p><p>Share your thoughts about the Steel Cage match in the comments section below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpaGpwaGLBs7XSoWSsrKKWwba%2FjK2fmqabqHqjscKksGakqaOwqXnFqKOlp6eeu6h51rCcZqiRrq%2Bir8pmaWlqYw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
