That teasing approach at least makes sense in early scenes with Ali, where Rachel’s untidy nature is heavily suggested during her relationship’s honeymoon phase. Zlotowski cuts away from an intimate moment when Rachel says, “I don’t take the pill.” Then Ali covers them both with a blanket after reassuring Rachel that “There are other ways.” Soon after, Zlotowski ostentatiously pulls her camera around the corner from her characters when they, seated on a bathroom floor, bluntly prescribe each other’s hang-ups—“You’re an idealist, and I’m a pragmatist”; no, no, “you’re serene, and I’m dissatisfied”—before brushing off their musings by admitting that “we’re also a bit drunk. <a href=../../../other-peoples-children-movie-review-2023.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../simon-cowell-recovering-from-operation-after-breaking-back-in-e-bike-crash.html>Simon Cowell recovering from operation after breaking back in e-bike crash</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
