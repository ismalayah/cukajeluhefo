The network (@TV3nz) later tweeted: "Discussions with South Pacific are ongoing with regards to future of #AlmightyJohnsons. It's not definitely cancelled despite media reports."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But Griffin said a third season arc of 13 episodes was turned down by the network, as well as a counter offer for a "tele-movie" to wrap up season two's cliffhangers.</p><p>A "gutted" Griffin said all efforts to take the show to another network had been exhausted, but he was "proud" of what the show had achieved over its run.</p><p>Lead actor Emmett Skilton (@emmettskilton), who played Odin, <a href=#>tweeted earlier today</a>: "Sadly friends, Odins quest has ended for now ...</p><p>"It was such a great pleasure to create and share the world with each and every one of you."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><i>The Almighty Johnsons</i> - created by Griffin and Rachel Lang, and produced by South Pacific Pictures - featured many well known Kiwi stars, including Tim Balme, Keisha Castle-Hughes, Dean O'Gorman and Siobhan Marshall.</p><p>Its first season ran for 10 episodes in 2011, while its 13-episode second season aired between October, 2011, and February, 2012 and received $6.9 million of funding from NZ on Air, reported Throng.co.nz.</p><p>But <a href=#>Throng</a> said ratings for the show's second season were well down on the first, with 184,460 tuning in for the season premiere. The first season premiere had 334,480 viewers.</p><p>The second season had a positive reception from critics, with <i>Herald</i> reviewer <a href=#>Russell Baillie calling <i>Johnsons</i></a> "the strangest local show to sustain more than one season on prime time".</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>Baillie said season two had some of the "maddest and funniest" moments so far.</p><p>A <a href=#>petition</a> launched today asked TV3 to reconsider the decision "despite earlier committing to a third season and despite last season being left with a number of unanswered questions".</p><p>It said: "We need to save <i>The Almighty Johnsons</i>. Make TV3 reconsider their decision - you can help by signing this petition and sharing it with your friends on Facebook, Twitter and everything else."</p><p>A Facebook page called <a href=#>"Oh My God, Save the Almighty Johnsons"</a> has also been set up.</p><p>Fans took to Twitter to voice their displeasure after rumours began circulating earlier today.</p><p>"I feel a TV3 boycott coming on," said Chris H (@geogeek), while Mike Kilpatrick (@mikekilpatrick) said: "I hate that great local comedy drama is ignored in place of bulls**t reality/imported shows.

Too many unanswered questions, thanks for nothing NZ on Air."</p><p>And Lew (@LewStoddart) said: "I thought The Almighty Johnsons sounded silly & never watched it, but it had a large and loyal following, so canning it is a weird decision."</p><p>The cancellation was first reported by TV blogger Chris Philpott (@chrisphilpottnz) on Twitter.</p><p>TV3 <a href=#>also decided not to renew comedy show <i>Hounds</i></a> after one season, despite positive reviews.
