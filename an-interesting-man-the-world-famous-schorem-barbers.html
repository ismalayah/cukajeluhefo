The duo are currently on a world tour and in New Zealand this week with their travelling interactive barber show, which sees them cutting hair on stage.</p><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black">Their shop in Holland specialises in traditional, classic and signature haircuts, as well as hot-towel, straight-razor shaves. Their approach to cutting hair is an effort to preserve a vanishing craft from a lost era of time. Customers must opt for a haircut from a menu of 12 offered styles. Leen and Bertus do not take bookings and have a strict first-come, first-served policy.</p><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black">Bertus’ first memory of cutting was when he tried to do his own hair when he was a young boy after trying to dye it black with a sharpie. “When my mother saw that she freaked out of course, so that was not really the thing that got me into barbering, I guess that was the first mohawk I cut on a mate in my parents’ house with my dad’s Wahl Super Taper. "Leen’s brother was a hairdresser so I’m pretty sure that’s where Leen got it.”</p><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black">Leen and Bertus opened the shop five years ago with a very specific idea in mind, says Bertus, and have since found cult status when it comes to men’s hair. “I had the idea of a barbershop for quite some years. I had already bought myself two barber’s chairs, I knew exactly what I wanted but as easy as good ideas come to me I’m just not an entrepreneur so I called in the cavalry, Leen. When we found that 125-year-old back bar we knew we had something special and built the rest of the shop around it, turning it into a place where you felt like stepping back in time.”</p><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black">People now travel from throughout the world to their salon. Bertus tells of one customer who has remained particularly poignant in their memory: a boy in a wheelchair who came in with his father, with visiting Schorem on the boy’s bucket list.</p><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black">"Leen gave him a shave and a cut and we were told he had only a few days to live. The guy had a great time and his dad was standing next to him holding in his tears because he saw his kid was having so much fun. We were cracking jokes and fighting back our tears as well.</p><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black">"Two days later the kid died and his father came to thank us and broke down, so did Leen and I and the three of us stood their crying. It made us realise again that life is short and you should turn it into a meaningful one."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/gJHgOsTdYoIGBj1wfwwpfKFSnms=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/56HEKMXSOSPHQTJPZA5M3A44MI.jpg"><p data-test-ui=viva-article-paragraph class="tw-mb-4 tw-font-proxima tw-text-lg tw-font-normal tw-leading-6 tw-text-black"><strong>BERTUS</strong><br><strong>An average day looks like...</strong> I don't do average days, average kills me. I wake up, spend some time with my boy and dog, eat my veges, take a run or go to the gym to get the motor started. I work in the barbershop, in the academy, I do photoshoots, I make movies, I do all our social media.&nbsp;I try to travel a lot, spend times with my team, train them on Monday.
