All the depravity we bore witness to in the TNT Twins‚Äô mansion, the fight between Homelander and Billy Butcher, and even Starlight losing it at the end of the episode and blowing the whistle on everything is nothing compared to the cathartic character arc of A-Train, which came to its climactic pinnacle during today‚Äôs episode.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>The first instance of this involved Hughie, who bumped into the fastest man alive ‚Äî at least in The Boys universe ‚Äî and asked him to apologize for Robin‚Äôs death, emboldened by the temporary Compound V running through his veins. Much to his surprise, however, A-Train apologizes for real for the first time after three seasons and even breaks down crying.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Later, A-Train confronts Blue Hawk, the racist supe who paralyzed his brother during last week‚Äôs episode and has been terrorizing Black neighborhoods. Risking death by heart attack, A-Train grabs hold of Blue Hawk and kills him by dragging him across miles of asphalt. His heart gives out then, seemingly killing off the character.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>The Boys fans have since been celebrating A-Train‚Äôs redemption arc, though according to the posts they‚Äôve been sharing on social media, they‚Äôre not buying his death for one second.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>A-Train after doing something useful for the first time in his life <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/X8kkxoLTGA</a></p>‚Äî JT‚Ä¢üçû (@JayTaylor009) <a href=#>June 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>when A-Train kabal‚Äôd Blue Hawk‚Äôs ass <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oqTR0SawnO</a></p>‚Äî sora (@HomelanderShill) <a href=#>June 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>A-train killing Blue Hawk was fucking Awesome,Not Only was it brutal ,but it was perfect symbolism of how black people were often Lynched by being dragged via horse and then cars/trucks until they were disfigured and dead, Poetic ending to that Racist Fuck<a href=#>#TheBoysTV</a> <a href=#>#Blackpower</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pYVYjefTvP</a></p>‚Äî THE PLUG (@DreaDs2LoNg) <a href=#>June 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me watching A-Train drag Blue Hawk<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4ljr0aEET8</a></p>‚Äî Smiso (@directorsmiso) <a href=#>June 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I lowkey thought A-Train wasn‚Äôt gonna do anything that serious to Blue Hawk when he went up to him‚Ä¶ til that mf did a whole FATALITY</p>‚Äî sora (@HomelanderShill) <a href=#>June 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>the boys spoilers ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è<a href=#>#Herogasm</a> was definitely one of the most satisfying episodes so far. everything from a-train confronting blue hawk, hughie punching a-train. that 3v1 and not to mention starlight‚Äôs live. 10/10 episode. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Tsp6o3xgKk</a></p>‚Äî üåë (@Malevolentshrn3) <a href=#>June 24, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>herogasm <a href=#>#Herogasm</a> spoilers<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>a-train after dragging blue hawk across the road <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rbzYAGCu4H</a></p>‚Äî alan b.
